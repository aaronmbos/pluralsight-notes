A Beginners Guide to React Introduction
--Kent Dodds
Can use unpkg to add React and ReactDOM scripts to page
  React is used to create elements
  ReactDOM is used to render the React elements
Babel is used to convert jsx to javascript
  Worth spending time to learn how jsx is transpiled to valid js
  Get Babel from unpkg
React Fragments can be used to render multiple elements
  Allows elements to be put side by side without needing container element i.e. div
  <><span></span></>
Components must be named with starting uppercase (this includes function components)
PropTypes allows for component prop validation - available as an npm package
  PropTypes are not applied in production
JavaScript expressions are allowed in JSX curly braces
React rerenders only what is needed via a diff
  Updates DOM surgically to only update what has changed
Style prop accepts an object with camel cased css props
Manage state with the useState hook
React.useEffect to interact with local storage or any other side effect for that matter
