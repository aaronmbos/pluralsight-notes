C# Command Design Pattern
- Filip Ekberg

Command Pattern Characteristics
  Command
    A command contains all the data to process the request now or at a later time
  Receiver
    A repository for example
  Invoker
    Potentially a command manager that handles invoking commands
  Client

The command pattern can easily be leveraged to allow undo or redo functionality
  ICommand
    CanExecute() : bool
      Determine if the command can be executed or not
    Execute() : void
    Undo() : void

Introducing the command pattern can add complexity
New commands can be introduced without updating existing to avoid breaking existing code
Allows for separation of concern, which improves testability
