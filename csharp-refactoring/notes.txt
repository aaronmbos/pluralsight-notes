Refactoring for C# Developers
Introducing Refactoring and Code Smells
- Steve Smith

What is refactoring?
    A change made to internal structure of software w/o changing observable behavior
    Increase internal quality
Why refactor?
    How to improve design and quality of our code
    Future changes will be more expensive
    Refactoring is very similar to editing
        First Draft -> First Revision -> Final Version
When and how to do it?
    Red -> Green -> Refactor
    Try to refactor at development time
    Pain Driven Development -> does current design cause difficulty
    Part of fixing a bug or part of a code review
    Don't wait until code gets bad
When not to refactor?
    Avoid refactoring when you don't understand how the current app works
        Difficult to verify refactoring
    Massive technical debt in place
    Imminent deadline
    Follow the boy scout rule: Leave your code better than you found it
Refactoring process
    Make sure current working code is committed
    Verify current working state of application with automated tests
    Apply a refactoring
    Confirm original behavior has been confirmed
Writing Characterization Tests : Test that the system does whatever it is supposed to do
    Write a test you know will fail
    Use failing test output to capture current behavior
    Update test to assert current behavior, then run test again to pass
    Tip: Helpful to run test with multiple different inputs
What are code smells?
    A surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in that system
    Shared vocabulary for areas of code that should be cleaned up (helpful for communicating intent)
    Principle of Least Astonishment: "Do what users expect"
        Design APIs from perspective of programers who will consume them
        Be simple, be clear
    Code Smells by C# Organizational Hierarchy
        Statement Smells
        Method Smells
        Class Smells
Key Takeaways
    Refactoring improves design without changing behavior
    Refactor while adding value
    Recognize common code smells
    Organize code smells by impact and code hierarchy

Statement Smells
Smell: Primitive Obsession - overuse of primitives instead of better abstractions or data structures resulting in excess code
    Introduce name variable or use named arguments
    Replace primitive with Constant
    Replace with enum
Smell: Vertical Separation
    Define, assign, and use variables and functions near where they are used
Smell: Inconsistency
    Be consistent in naming, formatting, etc
Smell: Poor Names
    Use descriptive, unambiguous names
    Stay at appropriate level of abstraction
    Follow standards
    Use longer names for longer scopes
    Don't encode or abbreviate
Smell: Switch Statements & Complext if-else Chains - indicates lack of proper use of object oriented design
    Its common for switch statements to bread repitition
Smell: Duplicate Code - Duplication is the root of all software evil. Follow DRY principle
Smell: Dead Code
    Get rid of useless code that is never executed. Causes clutter and reduces readability
Smell: Hidden Temporal Coupling - Certain operations must be called in a certain sequence, but design does not enforce this beahvior
    Can use template method pattern to address
