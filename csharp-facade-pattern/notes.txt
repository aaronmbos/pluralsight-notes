C# Facade Design Pattern
- David Starr

Big Ball of Mud Problem
  Martin Fowler
  Use facade class to encapsulate functionality in ball of mud class and expose only what is needed

Several service classes with methods to call
  Consumer must new up services and call methods
  Can introdue a facade class and interface for the consumer to interact with
    Avoid reacting with the service classes themselves and only the facade 

"Poor man's inversion of control"

Use a facade to provide a single interface to multiple worker classes
Can be used to mask giant classes
The facade can be more testable and easier to work with than direct implementations (multiple workers/big ball of mud classes)
