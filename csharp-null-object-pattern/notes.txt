C# Null Object Design Pattern
- David Starr

Reduce the amount of null checks that are required

Sir Tony Hoare
  Inventor of quicksort
  Created null reference in 1965 aka "Billion dollar mistake"

Each null check increase cyclomatic complexity

Create a "Null Object" that is used as a default object when value is not provided
  Recipient can rely on the Null Object type never being null

The null object can be implemented with inheritance (base class) or composition (interface)

Naming convention Null[TypeName]

Essentially provides a default value which reduces complexity and results in cleaner code
